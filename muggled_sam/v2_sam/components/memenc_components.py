class MaskDownsampler(nn.Module):

    Simplified implementation of the 'mask downsampler' from:

    The purpose of the model is to prepare raw mask predictions so that they
    can be combined with raw image encoding results to form a 'memory encoding'.

    This implementation combines functionality that is otherwise spread out in
    the original implementation. Most notably, it is made out of an original
    module of the same name which performs downsampling, see:
    https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything-2/blob/7e1596c0b6462eb1d1ba7e1492430fed95023598/sam2/modeling/memory_encoder.py#L17

    But some pre-processing steps, from a different component in the original
    implementation, is also included here as it seems like a more intuitive
    location for this functionality, see:
    https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything-2/blob/7e1596c0b6462eb1d1ba7e1492430fed95023598/sam2/modeling/sam2_base.py#L684-L695

    This module itself comes from another paper (see figure 4):

        By: Zhuang Liu, Hanzi Mao, Chao-Yuan Wu, Christoph Feichtenhofer, Trevor Darrell, Saining Xie
        @ https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545

    This implementation is only slightly different from the original, with a minor structural change
    to better indicate the 'inverted bottleneck' component along with renaming layers
    to more closely describe their usage. This implementation also uses 1x1 convolutions
    instead of linear layers for simplicity.
    (the original notes that this may be slower, but if it is, it's hard to measure)

    The original implementation can be found here:
    https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything-2/blob/7e1596c0b6462eb1d1ba7e1492430fed95023598/sam2/modeling/memory_encoder.py#L62

    From (very limited) testing, this module doesn't seem to contribute much to the
    overall model performance, that is, it can be skipped without much effect!

class Conv2DPerChannel(nn.Conv2d):
    """
    Defined to avoid confusion!

    This is referred to as a 'depth-wise' convolution in the
    original implementation (and elsewhere, it seems to be a standard term),
    but I find this to be confusing terminology, since the behavior
    is a convolution that specifically doesn't act along the
    depth (channels) of the input.
    It seems to be meant in the sense of a 'per-channel' convolution.

    Normal 2D convolution performs dot-products between small
    2D windows of the input (based on the 'kernel_size') and
    all values along the entire depth (i.e. all channels) to produce
    a single number. That is, it performs dot-products between
    two tensors of shape: (C, ky, kx), where k is the 2D kernel size
    and C is the 'in_channels' config parameter. This is repeated with 'N'
    different kernels, where 'N' is the 'out_channels' config parameter.

    By contrast, this module performs convolutions on each channel independently.
    This means that each 2D window acts on only a single channel,
    so that values along the depth dimension are not mixed together.
    In other words, it performs dot-products between tensors of
    shape (1, ky, kx). This is repeated C times to produce an output
    that also has C channels (where each channel uses a unique kernel).
